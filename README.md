# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Simple Tic-Tac-Toe project created with vanilla javascript, html and css. 

It can be played in 2 modes:
* player vs player
* player vs computer

There are also 3 options for the second mode:
* easy
* medium
* impossible

The impossible AI is based on a minimax algorithm, whilst the other 2 are just versions with flaws of this one.
